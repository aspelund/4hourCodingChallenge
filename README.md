4hourCodingChallenge
====================

Some coding challenges to improve your programming skill

I want to be a better developer. In order to be that, I believe practicing different tasks are vital. At the same time, my time is precious, so timeboxing the practice might be a good idea.

So that's why I created this little challenge - What kind of code can I produce that is interesting and that I learn something from in four hours?

Challenge #1 - Svn Tetris
=========================
Create a working tetris clone using Javascript. Use Svg for graphics rendering. Do as much as you can in four hours.
Use no more than 4 hours. Publish your work and tell [@aspelund](http://twitter.com/aspelund) about it.
